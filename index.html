</h3>

<p>Dive into a wealth of audio engineering expertise. Everything from sales on VST plugins to audio circuit design. Whether you seek to get started as a mixing or mastering engineer, if 48-track Neve consoles and vintage RCA microphones get you excited, this is the section for you.</p>

<h3>
<a id="producer" class="anchor" href="#producer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="production.html">Producer</a>
</h3>

<p>You're great with peopleâ€“ especially tempermental musicians. Sometimes it's difficult for you to find inspiration to write your own music but you know a hit record the moment you hear it. You have a host of raw-talent friends that record demos on GarageBand. Your celebrity crush is Rick Rubin. You're a producer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="songwriter" class="anchor" href="#songwriter" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="songwriting.html">Songwriter</a>
</h3>

<p>The only person able to understand music quite the way you do is Bob Dylan. Who cares if they aren't in key all the time! You've written five songs in five different guitar tunings. Your latest song would be PERFECT on your favorite artist's new album.</p>

<p>Music has always spoken not necessarily possessing the Frank Sinatra voice or Jimi Hendrix dexterity. You've always supported the music of those in your personal circle, and you think their last record is really something special. Your cousin Paper Boi needs someone to check out his contract. Maybe you've already got some connections in the biz, Uncle Bob who coincidentally works A&amp;R for Universal owes you one.</p>
